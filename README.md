- Contains scripts for fMRI data preprocessing and first-level GLM analysis.
- Implements the following functionalities:
  - Sort data into BIDS compatible folder structure
  - Preprocessing
      - Realignment
      - Coregistration
      - Segmentation
      - Functional and structural normalization
      - Smoothing
  - First-level GLM
      - Extract onsets
      - Extract motion regressors
      - GLM specification and estimation
      - Contrast specification and estimation
- Go to "main.m" for a more detailed overview and run the script in full
- The scripts are adapted to process the bistable tactile perception data collected during the course
